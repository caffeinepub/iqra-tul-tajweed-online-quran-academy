  "summary": "Diff adds a TanStack Router-based 5-page marketing site with shared header/footer, centralized content config, themed Tailwind styling, and placeholder-driven Tutors/Contact data. However, deployment/routing-on-IC specifics are not evidenced, and at least one Home benefits item does not match the required wording exactly. Several authentication/actor-related hooks and attribution were added beyond the marketing-site requirements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Home page benefits section must list the 5 benefits exactly as specified: “2 free trial classes, flexible timing, no age limit, separate male/female tutors, and one-on-one classes.”",
      "reason": "The centralized benefits titles differ from the exact required phrasing (e.g., “First 2 Trial Classes Free” vs “2 free trial classes”; “Flexible Class Timing” vs “flexible timing”; “Separate Tutors for Male & Female” vs “separate male/female tutors”).",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Ensure the project can be deployed on the Internet Computer with a repeatable standard dfx workflow and confirm frontend assets and all routes work after deployment (including direct navigation to non-home routes).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no deployment documentation or IC asset/routing configuration changes (e.g., dfx.json adjustments, asset canister SPA routing settings, or a deployment flow description). Presence of a frontend/public/404.html is mentioned in a file summary, but that file content is not shown in the diff summary and there is no explicit evidence that IC deployment and direct-route handling are configured and verified.",
